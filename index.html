    <h1>Emojinal Intelligence </h1>
    <div class="info">
        <p>We screenshot every text we wrote on our phone which includes an Emoji for one week. Then we will blur the text in order to focus on our everyday use of emojis. <br> We will crop the screenshots to squares and display them on our website. Additionally,
            we will list all the emojis the three of us used over the course of the week. By clicking on a Name it displays the emojis this person has used.
            <br> We will blur the text in our screenshots using Photoshop’s smudge tool. This makes the emojis stand out and guarantees privacy. We first show all of our collected emojis together to emphasize the importance of emojis in the way we communicate.
            The websites where it only shows the emojis of one of us reveals something about each individual. The goal is to visualize which emojis we use and also what importance the emojis hold in our every-day communication. Also we want to make people
            aware that imagery has gained more recognition and consider whether it might be possible that an only image based language is still in its roots and finding its way. We learned that if you track an action you automatically change your behavior
            and adapt to the situation which leads to a distortion of data. This leads to a general questioning of our digital behavior. The expressions we do while talking are produced in written text with emojis which possibly explains the high usage.
